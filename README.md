# Payments APISuite Extension 

This is the repo for the components that make up the APISuite's Payment Extension.

## Scope

ESA has a service called CropSAR that is used to monitor crops through image satellites: https://viewer.terrascope.be/terrascope/.

The goal of this Extension is to "easily" plug something in-between the data flow to CropSAR that allows monetisation to happen "out of the box".

For more information, see the Extension's PoC documentation in [Confluence](https://cloudoki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ESA/pages/141590537/CropSAR+POC).
